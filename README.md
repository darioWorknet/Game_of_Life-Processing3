# GAME OF LIFE in Processing 3

Personal implementation of the classical game: Game of Life.

Aesthetics based on Ubuntu interface.

Explanation:
	- When starts, cells are filled randomly, so game does not start with a blank board
	- To pause the game you can press SPACE
	- To add live cells, press left-click
	- To delete cells, press right-click

That's all. Enjoy!!!
